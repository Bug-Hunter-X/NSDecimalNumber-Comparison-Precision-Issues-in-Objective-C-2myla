The solution is to leverage the `compare:` method of `NSDecimalNumber` for accurate comparisons. This method accounts for potential precision differences and provides a reliable comparison result.  Hereâ€™s the corrected code:

```objectivec
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    @autoreleasepool {
        NSDecimalNumber *number1 = [NSDecimalNumber decimalNumberWithString:@
